title: Multiple-Review System
---

The Multiple-Review Oracle System ensures that each real estate asset uploaded to the ReitCircles portal is reviewed and confirmed by two reviewers before proceeding to the NFT minting process. This system upholds transparency and verifiability, aligning with the blockchain principle of transparency.

## What You Need to Know

### Uploading Documents

After uploading your asset documents, they are assigned to two reviewers. The status of your documents will be marked as **Pending** during the review process.

### Review Process

Both reviewers will review and confirm the documents. If only one reviewer completes the review, the asset cannot proceed to the NFT minting process.

### Notification

Once both reviewers have reviewed and confirmed the documents, you will be notified on the portal. The notification will indicate that your documents have been successfully reviewed.

### Minting the Asset as an NFT

After receiving the notification, navigate to the **Mint** tab. You will see a **Mint** button if the asset is ready for the NFT minting process. Click the **Mint** button to proceed with minting your asset as an NFT.
