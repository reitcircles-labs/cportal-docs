title: NFT Minting
---

Minting your real estate asset as an NFT on the [ReitCircles Portal](https://devportal.reitcircles.com) is the next step after [onboarding your assets](onboarding-assets.md), and the documents submitted have been verified.

The NFT minting process involves converting real estate assets into NFTs and listing them on the [ReitCircles marketplace](https://reitcircles.com/marketplace/). To mint your assets as NFTs on the portal, you need to ensure that all your documents have been submitted for review and have been reviewed.

To mint your assets as NFTs, follow this process:

### Confirm Asset Documents Review

Once your asset documents are reviewed and approved by the verification team, you will receive a notification on the portal.

Log in to the ReitCircles portal, in the dashboard, click on the Projects tab, and then click on the Asset you created.
To check if you asset documents have been reviewed, click on **Documents** tab.

You will see a check mark ✅ with _Review has been completed for this asset_ as shown in the image below.

### Pay and Confirm Transaction

To proceed, you will be required to pay 784 ₳ (ADA tokens). When you click on **Process**, you will be redirected to your  [Nami](https://www.namiwallet.io) or [Eternl](https://eternl.io) wallet, depending on which you registered with and connected to your browser.

In the wallet's confirmation window as shown below, review the details, enter your wallet password and sign the transaction to authorize the minting. This might take some seconds to process.

## Accessing the NFT Data

After minting the asset as an NFT, you can access additional information about the asseet which is stored on the [Arweave blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/).

- Once the minting process is complete, the NFT data will be available on [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io/). Note that it might take a few minutes for the data to appear after minting.

- The asset ownership details are also attached to the NFT. As [mentioned above](#view-the-asset-nft-minted), you can view the NFT and other minting details. This ensures transparency and verifiability of asset ownership on the blockchain.
