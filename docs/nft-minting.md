Minting your real estate asset as an NFT on the ReitCircles portal is the next step after [onboarding your assets](onboarding-assets.md), and the documents submitted have been verified.

The NFT minting process involves converting realestate assets into NFTs and listing them on the ReitCircles marketplace. To mint your assets as NFTs on the portal, you need to ensure that all your documents have been submitted for review and have been reviewed.

### Verification Approval

Once your asset documents are reviewed and approved by the verification team, you will receive a notification on the portal.

### Initiate Minting

Navigate to the asset details page from your dashboard. Click on the **Mint NFT** button to start the minting process.

### Confirm Transaction

A confirmation window will appear. Review the details and confirm the transaction. You may need to enter your wallet password to authorize the minting.

### Minting in Progress

The minting process will take a few moments. You will see a progress bar indicating the status of the minting.

### Minting Complete

Once the minting is complete, you will receive a notification, and your asset will be displayed as an NFT in your wallet and on the ReitCircles portal.

Congratulations! Your real estate asset is now securely stored as an NFT on the blockchain.
