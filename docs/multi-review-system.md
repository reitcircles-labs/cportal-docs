The Multiple-Review Oracle System ensures that each real estate asset uploaded to the ReitCircles portal is reviewed and confirmed by two reviewers before proceeding to the NFT minting process. This system upholds transparency and verifiability, aligning with the blockchain principle of transparency.


To review a document, you must first be assigned the reviewer role, which gives you access to the Reveiwing documents section of the ReitCircles portal.

When you have the reviewer role, follow the steps below to review an asset's documents:

1. Sign into the portal, click on **General** in the mid-left section, and then click on **My Asset Audit**. You will then see the latest documents submitted for review, a section to preview each of the documents submitted for review, and also a section to add comments you have after review.

And that's it you have successfully reviewed the asset's documents! The other reviewer assigned will also participate in the review process.


> **Note:** Reviews are required from all the reviewers for the asset to be approved. If only one reviewer completes the review, the asset cannot proceed to the NFT minting process. The multi-review process ensures that all documents are thoroughly checked and verified, maintaining the integrity and transparency of the ReitCircles platform, in line with the principles of blockchain technology.
