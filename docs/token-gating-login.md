This is a step-by-step guide on how to login and use the [ReitCircles](https://reitcircles.com/) portal to store your Real Estate Assets on-chain, which is stored using the Arweave blockchain.


### Step 1: Visit the Portal

Visit [ReitCircles Portal](https://devportal.reitcircles.com/#/login), agree to the terms and privacy policy, then use either your [Nami](https://www.namiwallet.io) or [Eternl](https://eternl.io) wallet to register.

### Step 2: Registering with Eternl Wallet

If you choose to use [Eternl](https://eternl.io) and click on it, the Eternl wallet window pops up (if you have installed the extension and connected it to your browser). Click on **Grant Access** to continue the registration:

### Step 4: Choose a Subscription Plan

After signing and connecting your Eternl wallet, you will need to choose a subscription plan on [ReitCircles](https://reitcircles.com/). This will mint an NFT which will be deposited in your wallet, giving you access to use the ReitCircles portal.

### Step 5: Pay the Subscription Fee

Based on the subscription plan you choose, you will be asked to pay an amount of ADA from your connected wallet. For example, if you choose the Gold plan, it costs 189 ADA as shown below:

Click on "Confirm" to continue. This will open the Eternl wallet window in your browser and require you to enter your password to sign the transaction.

### Step 6: Transaction Successful

When the transaction is successful and your NFT token needed to access the portal has been minted, the **Transaction Successful** window will be displayed, with a pop-up of the minting at the top right of your screen.
