The Multiple-Review Oracle System ensures transparency and verifiability for each real estate asset uploaded to the ReitCircles portal. This system requires that asset documents be reviewed and confirmed by two reviewers before proceeding to the NFT minting process.

This is the review process for Admins.

1. Have the review role assigned 
2. Click on the "Asset Audit Overview" and enter the asset ID of the asset's document to be reviewed.
3. The system will automatically assign an asset ID to a reviewer, which you will receive. 
4. The asset IDs are sent to the reviewers when the documents are uploaded
