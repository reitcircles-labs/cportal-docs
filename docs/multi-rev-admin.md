title: Multiple-Review System for Admins
---

The Multiple-Review Oracle System ensures transparency and verifiability for each real estate asset uploaded to the ReitCircles portal. This system requires that asset documents be reviewed and confirmed by two reviewers before proceeding to the NFT minting process.

This is the review process for Admins.

### Access the Review Section

Sign in to the ReitCircles portal, and navigate to the **Admin Section** Then click on the **Review** button in the left menu to access the review section.

### Enter Asset ID

Enter the Asset ID of the document you need to review. You will then see the documents that need to be reviewed.

### Review Documents

Review each document thoroughly. Set the status to **Accepted** and add any relevant comments.

### Complete the Review

After reviewing all documents, enter the asset's address, sign with your wallet and submit the review.

### Notification and Minting

Once both reviewers have completed their reviews and confirmed the documents, the user is notified on the portal. The asset can now proceed to the NFT minting process, accessible via the mint tab where a **Mint** button will appear.

> **Note:** Both reviews are required for the asset to be approved. If only one reviewer completes the review, the asset cannot proceed to the NFT minting process.
