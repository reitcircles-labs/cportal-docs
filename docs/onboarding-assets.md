[ReitCircles](https://reitcircles.com/) offers freedom, flexibility, and peace of mind for all real estate owners. Through the portal, you can store and mint your real estate as NFTs. This guide provides a step-by-step process for onboarding assets onto the ReitCircles portal.

# Onboarding the Asset

After completing the registration on the portal, the next step is to onboard your real estate property, referred to as an asset. In this section, we will go through the steps involved in onboarding your asset. Letâ€™s begin!

### Step 1

Sign in to the [ReitCircles portal](https://reitcircles.com/), and in your dashboard, click on **Projects** and then the **+** button to add a project. You need to first add a Project before adding an asset. A project is a collection of related assets, such as a housing development with multiple properties.
Think of a project as a large housing project that includes several smaller assets.

To onboard an asset, you will need to complete three steps: **Introduction**, **Offer Creation**, **Documents**, and **Minting**. Each of these steps will require you to add information about the asset such as the asset name, type of asset, location, upload market details (pictures and other information) of the asset, and then submit the documents for review.
